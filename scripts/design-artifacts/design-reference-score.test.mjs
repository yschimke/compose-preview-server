/**
 * The scorer's contract that does NOT need a browser: the verdict bands, and the fail-soft posture
 * when there is nothing to score with.
 *
 * The scoring itself is deliberately not re-asserted here. Its whole design is that it runs the
 * viewer's own `format-compare.js` rather than a copy, so a test that pinned expected percentages
 * would be testing that asset — and would have to be rewritten every time the scorer legitimately
 * improved, which is exactly the pressure that produces a second, drifting implementation.
