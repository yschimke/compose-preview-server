// The **Page theme** setting: whether the site chrome follows the SELECTED PREVIEW THEME or the
// visitor's operating system. Replaces `assets/page-theme.js`.
//
// The catalog's Theme control re-renders the previews; until this existed it said nothing about the
// page around them, which followed `prefers-color-scheme` alone. So opening `…/m3-catalog/?theme=dark`
// handed a dark grid to a light page — the one combination nobody picked. With the setting on (the
// default) the chrome follows the choice instead.
//
// It is a SETTING, not a second toggle, because it is a standing preference rather than page state:
// somebody who keeps their machine in dark mode all day can turn it off in the header's Settings
// menu and keep the OS behaviour everywhere, without touching a control again. That is also why it
// is not carried in the URL — a shared link describes the previews, not the reader's chrome.
//
// Mechanically the whole feature is `color-scheme`: `serve.css` writes every mode-dependent value as
// a `light-dark()` pair, so pinning the scheme with `cp-scheme-light` / `cp-scheme-dark` on `<html>`
// repaints chrome, catalog palette and semantic badges together, with no second stylesheet to keep
// in step. The class is first set by the pre-paint script in `<head>` (`ServeWeb.pageThemeScript`),
// so a page served under `?theme=dark` never flashes light; this keeps it in step afterwards and
// owns the Settings menu.
