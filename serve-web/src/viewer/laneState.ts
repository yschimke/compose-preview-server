// un-press every chip: the Live chip, a combo pick, an SVG swap, the spec chip, Back/Forward. Miss
// one route and a chip stays lit over a lane that is no longer showing, which is a control claiming
// something untrue rather than a control that fails to work.

 * a catalog produced `…?rcPlayer=cmp-android`.
 *
 * Fixing it by hardcoding `cmp-android` instead would only have moved the assumption. A preview
 * pinning `RemoteViewPreviewWrapper` bakes through the VIEW player, so on it `cmp-android` is a
 * genuine re-render that MUST keep naming itself while `java` becomes the silent one — and the
