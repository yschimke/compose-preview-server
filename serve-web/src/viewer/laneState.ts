// un-press every chip: the Live chip, a combo pick, an SVG swap, the spec chip, Back/Forward. Miss
// one route and a chip stays lit over a lane that is no longer showing, which is a control claiming
// something untrue rather than a control that fails to work.

 * `RemoteComposePlayerKind.EMBEDDED`), and what the baked artifact a bare URL serves already
 * contains. Naming it would be a parameter that changes nothing.
 *

 * default is the Java view player". That has not been true for some time, and believing it cost a
 * URL: the viewer seeded its pick state from this answer, so a first click from a catalog produced
 * `…?rcPlayer=cmp-android` — a URL that reads as a deliberate player choice, is a no-op, and splits
 * one rendering across two cache entries.
 *
 * Dropping it here is only safe because the server no longer answers `?rcPlayer=cmp-android` from
 * the staged `embedded` comparison raster: it asks the session which player the capture went
 * through (`ServeHost.bakedRcPlayer`) and, when that is the embedded one, both routes resolve to
 * the same baked artifact. See `publishedRcPlayerRender`. `java` is not listed because asking for it
 * is a deliberate change away from the default, which `serverPlayerParam` still emits.
 *
 * The residue is a label, not pixels. A preview pinning `RemoteViewPreviewWrapper` baked through the
 * view player, so its bare URL serves that capture while this chip still reads "CMP Android" — the
 * server answers such a request correctly (the parameter is a real re-render there, not a no-op),
 * but nothing yet reports the per-preview default back to the viewer for it to label. No preview in
 * any catalog we publish pins that wrapper today.
