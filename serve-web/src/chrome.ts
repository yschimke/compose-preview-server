// Entry point for the page-shell bundle (`assets/serve-chrome.js`).
//
// What EVERY serve page needs, and nothing else: the URL-state global and the Page theme setting.
// `ServeWeb.document` emits this unconditionally — the front door and `/status` included — so it
// must stay small and must carry no Vue. The report classification element is the one controller
// here: catalog report forms occur on both component and index pages, so their always-present shell
// owns that wiring rather than making every surface entry repeat it.
//
// Order matters, and this file is where it is stated: `installUrlState` publishes
// `window.cpUrlState` at evaluation, and the component bundle plus `format-compare.js`,
// `rc-lanes.js` and `spec-compare.js` all read that global. So the shell emits this bundle ahead of
// every surface's own scripts, and everything downstream can assume it.
