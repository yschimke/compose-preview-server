// agree byte for byte — the block is canonical bytes so two records are comparable without parsing
// one, and the producer that indexes reports refuses a non-canonical field rather than storing a
// guess. `test/reportLocator.test.ts` asserts this module against the SHARED fixture the Kotlin
// writer and the JavaScript parser are already pinned to, so no engine can move the contract alone.
//
// The invariants are enforced here, at the point the rectangle is MADE, exactly as
// `ServeIssueReport.Bounds` enforces them in its constructor. A writer that emits a rectangle its
// own producer refuses hands the reporter a prefilled body that looks right and takes the whole
// issue out of the index when the workflow next runs — a failure with no symptom until someone
// wonders why the report never appeared.
