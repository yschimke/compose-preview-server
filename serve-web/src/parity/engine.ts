// The typed seam onto the shared acceptance engine.
//
// `scripts/design-artifacts/*.mjs` is plain JavaScript with `node --test` behind it, and `tsc` reads
// it with `allowJs`/`checkJs: false` — inference only. That works for most of the surface and fails
// in exactly one place: a parameter with a default of `null` or `[]` infers as `null` or `never[]`,
// so a call passing a real comparison or a real mask list is a type error against a signature the
// implementation does not actually have.
//
// The alternatives were worse. Annotating the JavaScript with JSDoc types would put a TypeScript
// concern inside the contract's reference implementation, which `design-parity` and a future Kotlin
// reader also read. Weakening the call sites to `any` would lose the shapes at the point they are
// most useful. So the widening happens **here, once**, next to the reason for it: this file states
// the engine's shape as this consumer relies on it, and every other file in `src/parity/` is
// ordinarily typed against it.
//
// If one of these declarations drifts from the implementation, the conformance suite next door does
// not catch it — it runs the JavaScript directly. What catches it is that the adapter stops
// compiling, or stops working; keep the declarations minimal so there is little to drift.
