 * 2. the pairing's own theme, when it is genuinely `light` or `dark`.
 * 3. [stage] — the catalog's declared stage, which the wall carries as `data-default-theme`.
 *
 * Rung 3 is what this used to answer `"light"` for unconditionally. That is wrong for a dark-first
 * catalog, where a theme-neutral component is still drawn for a black watch face: its
 * white-on-transparent sticker landed on the light sheet and read as nearly blank, in the table
 * meant to compare it (yschimke/wear-m3-catalog#56). "Neutral" means neutral *between the catalog's
