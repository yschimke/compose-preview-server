// once: filed page-scoped, that issue carries no identity, so the catalog's index skips it and it
// never appears in the Bugs column of any of the four rows it is about.
//
// An umbrella issue naming several components is a shape the format already has. This is the part
// that decides what one ticked row contributes to it.
