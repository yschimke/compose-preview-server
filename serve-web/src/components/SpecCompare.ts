// `<cp-spec-compare>` — the viewer's design-spec diff options. Replaces `assets/spec-compare.js`.
//
// The spec lane already put the imported design reference on the same stage as the render, so the
// two could be flipped between. Flipping is a weak instrument: it answers "are these different?" by
// asking a visitor to hold one frame in their head while looking at the other, which finds a
// wholesale colour change and misses the 4dp of padding that is the actual bug. The focused
// `/compare/<id>` page has the real instruments, but reaching it means leaving the viewer — and
// with it every override, knob and theme that produced the render worth comparing. So the
// instruments come to the lane: Spec, Diff, Triptych, Slider, one click apart.
//
// Every surface is drawn from ONE normalisation pass, so the diff, the three panels and the wipe
// are all in the same pixel space — a reference exported at a different scale than the render lines
// up here instead of reading as a total mismatch.
//
// Renders nothing of its own: the panels, canvases and buttons are all server-rendered, because the
// lane has to exist before any of this runs. `serve.css` hides the tag.
//
// The decisions live next door: `spec/views.ts` (who gets to pick the view — three sources compete
// and they are not equal), `spec/verdict.ts` (what the chip and the readout say), `spec/wipe.ts`
// (where the seam sits), `dom/sameOrigin.ts` (what may reach a canvas at all).
