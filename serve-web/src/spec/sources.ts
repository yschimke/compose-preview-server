// Which source the spec lane is comparing the render against.
//
// The lane's four views — Spec, Diff, Triptych, Slider — are instruments over A PAIR OF IMAGES, and
// they are agnostic about where the second image came from. So a second comparison is a second
// SOURCE for the existing lane, not a second mode: the latching rules in `views.ts`, the single
// normalisation pass that keeps the four in one pixel space, and the URL state all carry over
// untouched (issue #4621).
//
// The decisions live here, next door to the lane, for the same reason `views.ts` and `verdict.ts`
// do: the lane itself is imperative DOM against a server-rendered picker, and the questions worth
// getting right — which source is active, whether a switch changes anything, what the panel should
// admit about where its pixels came from — are pure and answerable without a browser.
