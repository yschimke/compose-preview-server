// What the spec lane says about the pair in front of the visitor.
//
// Two surfaces report one comparison — the readout under the views, and the design-spec chip up in
// the identity row — and the reason they are decided together here is that they used to be able to
// disagree. The chip carries the score baked at PUBLISH; the moment an override, a knob or a theme
// moves the render, that number describes a frame that is no longer on the stage. So the lane
// overwrites it while it has a live measurement, and restores the published one on the way out —
// off the lane there is nothing live to describe, and leaving a knob-bent number there would
// misreport every later visit as if it were the publish.

// Shared rather than restated: the parity page decides a pair is worth opening on the same number
// this lane then judges it by, and the two disagreeing reads as a broken page.

 * comparison has no way to synthesise one. So the moment an override moves the render, the two
 * frames are answering different questions and any percentage taken across them is measuring the
 * override rather than the component.

 * identical and only the token colour moves, so 89% of the pixels "differ" and the lane reported
 * "90.5% match" — a number that reads as a parity finding and is nothing of the kind. Suppressing
 * it costs a reader nothing, because there was no honest number to lose.
 *
 * The changed-pixel count still goes out, because it is literally true about the two frames in
 * front of the visitor. What it is NOT is a verdict, and the line says so rather than leaving the
