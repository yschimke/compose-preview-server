// Bundles the serve web assets to IIFEs committed under the CLI's
// resources, where `ServeWebAssets` picks it up like any other static asset.
//
// Committed output, not a Gradle-driven build. `:cli` is a plain Kotlin/JVM
// module and the whole release chain (`installDist`, `distTar`, the GHCR image)
// runs without node; putting an npm build on that critical path would mean every
// CLI build, every release, and every sandbox needs a node toolchain to produce a
// tarball whose Kotlin didn't change. The vendored `codemirror.js` beside it is
// committed for the same reason. `npm run verify` (wired into CI) rebuilds and
// fails if the committed bundle has drifted from source, so "committed" can't
// quietly become "stale".
//
// Vue itself is one cacheable runtime and the controls are split by server surface. All entries
// stay classic scripts: Kotlin pages intentionally interleave synchronous inline bootstraps with
// generated assets, and converting only some of that chain to deferred modules would change when
// custom elements upgrade. `vue-runtime.js` therefore publishes the tiny `window.cpVue` façade
// synchronously; each surface bundle consumes it without bundling a second renderer.

// These bundles are loaded from different places and cost different amounts.
//
// `vue-runtime.js` is emitted immediately before exactly one surface component bundle. The
// catalog, compare, design, parity and viewer entries carry only the elements that can occur on
// that surface. This keeps Vue cacheable across navigations and removes both sources of waste from
// the old all-components bundle: unrelated controls and a second Vue copy in known differences.
//
// `serve-chrome.js` carries what EVERY page needs — the URL-state global and the
// Page theme setting — so the page shell emits it unconditionally, on the front
// door and `/status` too. Folding those into the component bundle would put
// Vue on a front door whose imagery is prebaked precisely so a visit
// costs the HTML and nothing else. Neither chrome module is a custom element, so
// this bundle carries no Vue at all and lands around 3 kB.
//
// The split also fixes an ordering problem a single bundle could not: chrome has
// to be evaluated BEFORE the components bundle and before the legacy scripts,
// because they read `window.cpUrlState` — while the components bundle stays
// where each surface already puts it.
//
// `keyboard-navigation.js` is also emitted by every page, but stays separate so
// its opt-in power-user UI can initialize after the complete page DOM exists.
//
// `report-capture.js` is the screen-capture tool behind the report launcher, and
// it is separate for the opposite reason to the shell: it is on NO page until
// somebody opens the launcher panel or lands on `/report-bug`, at which point
// `chrome/reportLauncher.ts` injects the tag. Folding it into the shell would put
// a selection overlay, a canvas cropper and the clipboard path on every front-door
// visit, none of which will ever run there.
//
// `format-compare.js` keeps its own name and tag because two consumers OUTSIDE the
// browser load that exact path — the publish-time reference-score driver and the
// compare audit — and because only the comparison surfaces need its several
// hundred lines. It is a generated file now rather than a hand-written one; the
// four external consumers are unaffected, since what they depend on is the path
// and the `window.ComposePreviewCompare` shape, both unchanged.
//
// `known-differences.js` is the acceptance band and the engine behind it, emitted only by the
// focused comparison. It is the heaviest bundle here after `viewer.js` because it carries the
// contract's whole reference implementation — the document ladder, five gates, a dependency-free
// PNG reader and the separated-plane scorer, shared verbatim with `scripts/design-artifacts/` so the
// browser and the offline driver cannot disagree about what an acceptance means. Folding it into
// a surface component bundle would put all of that on the catalog grid and design pages; folding it
// into `format-compare.js` would charge that file's four external consumers for a surface none of
// them uses.
//
// `viewer.js` is generated for the same reason and on the same terms: same path,
// same script tag, same position after `viewer-components.js` and
// `format-compare.js`. It stays its own bundle because only the viewer page
// carries it and it is by far the largest of these — folding 3,000 lines of lane
// machinery into a component bundle would put it on the catalog grid, the
// compare wall and the design pages, none of which have a stage to drive.
