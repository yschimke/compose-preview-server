//
// This is the half of the element that did not exist before: the comparison page carries only the
// producer-authored redline from a bundle's `annotations/index.json`, so the layers PROJECTED from
// the render's own semantics tree — typography, theme, layout — never reached the page where a
// parity report is actually filed. What that costs is not cosmetic: those layers are the targets an
// element selection points at, so without them the render side of the comparison has nothing to
// click.
