// `scripts/design-artifacts/fixtures/known-differences/`, which this adapter runs the very same
// implementation against. What no fixture there can reach is everything between a page and that
// implementation — a document fetched over HTTP, artifacts prefetched so a synchronous
// `readArtifact` can answer, a plane resolved from the two panels' own rasters rather than handed
// over, and a reader's status codes turned back into the three tokens §4 gives a reader.
//
// The last of those is the one worth a test of its own. `path-not-contained` and
// `artifact-too-large` are verdicts the *server* establishes and the engine only relays, so an
// adapter that collapsed them into "could not read" would leave two of the three unreachable from
// the browser — and the traversal is the one worth seeing.
