# Guard: the version-control-backed config overlay actually mounts the files it claims to.
#
# Why this needs a test. docker-compose.deploy-config.yml is opt-in, so nothing exercises it on the
# way to a release — the first time anyone finds out it is wrong is on a box, after a restart, when
# the app boots from whatever /config it already had and serves a stale catalog set. Every failure
# mode here is silent that way: a source path that doesn't exist makes Docker create an empty
# DIRECTORY at the mount point (and the app then reads no catalogs), a target that isn't nested
# under the base file's /config volume mounts somewhere the app never looks, and a dropped `:ro`
# lets the admin API write back into the git working tree so the next `git pull` conflicts.
#
# It is all static: no Docker, no network, no compose binary.
