# Seed the downloadable-font cache from the faces baked into the image (see the Dockerfile's
# `fonts` stage). `~/.cache/composeai/fonts` is a named volume, and a volume only inherits image
# content when it is FIRST created, so a box whose volume predates this change would otherwise
# never get them — copying on every boot covers both cases.
#
# The BAKED bytes win on a mismatch. The volume's copy has no authority: the catalog PNGs are
# rendered in CI from ITS font cache, never from this host, so an entry left here by an earlier
# runtime fetch is of unknown provenance and may already differ from what the PNG was rendered
# with. The baked set is the deterministic, release-pinned one, so on a long-lived box an upgrade
# has to be able to correct a drifted entry — otherwise the first stale fetch sticks forever.
# Replacement is via temp + `mv` so a torn copy is never visible to a render, and it happens before
# serve starts, so no daemon is holding the old typeface.
#
# Faces the image doesn't ship (e.g. a runtime-fetched Google Sans Flex) are left alone.
# Best-effort throughout — the renderer still fetches on a miss, exactly as it did before.

# served, but badged `unverified` until the image caught up.

# first boot only, never overwritten — so an operator edit, or a POST to /admin/trust (which
# rewrites this same file), survives every subsequent image roll. Falls back to serving the
# baked file read-only when /config isn't writable, exactly like the catalogs seed.

# different producers, or the literal `none` to run trustless (catalogs then show Unverified).
# NB opt-out is `none`, not empty — empty deliberately falls back to the default.

# When SERVE_LIVE_SEATS is unset we AUTO-DERIVE the budget from the box: reserve ~1 GB for the serve

# what the CPUs afford.
#
# **Memory alone was the wrong input.** A permit buys a render daemon, and a render is CPU-bound —
# so a box with plenty of RAM and few cores derived a budget it could not actually work, while the
# [2, 8] clamp meant a large box stopped scaling entirely. Measured on preview.coo.ee (48 GiB
# limit, 8 cores): memory afforded 40 permits, the clamp allowed 8, and the box ran a fifth of what
# its cores could have driven.
#
# `SEATS_PER_CPU` of 2 is one Android daemon per core, since Android costs two permits and is the
# heaviest backend. A render is not purely on-CPU — it waits on daemon startup and I/O — so one
# renderable slot per core would leave cores idle, and much more than two would thrash them.
#

# Operator-supplied JVM options, APPENDED to the image's own rather than replacing them.

# This exists because the obvious way to set a `composeai.*` system property on this deployment is
# a trap. The image bakes JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS into its ENV (heap ceiling, daemon library dirs, render
# timeouts, sandbox boot), and setting JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS from the compose file REPLACES that whole
# string — so the container comes up without its heap ceiling and without the paths the daemon lane
# needs, for the sake of one `-D`. The failure is silent and does not look related to the change.
#
# The workaround so far has been a dedicated CLI flag per knob (`--background-renders`,
# `--live-seats`), which is fine for the handful an operator sets often and does not scale: the
# twelve `composeai.serve.optimizer*` pressure thresholds are documented as "a property of the host,
# not of the code, and it needs to be settable without a rebuild", and on this image none of them
# were reachable at all. Appending covers the whole class, including knobs added later.
#
# Inherited by the daemon JVMs this process spawns, exactly as the baked options are — that is what
# makes it the right layer for a render-side property, and worth knowing before setting a heap flag
# here, which every sandbox would then take as its own.

# Re-assert the daemon sidecar directories if the JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS this container came up with
# lost them.
#
# The trap the append above documents has a second half. An operator who sets JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS
# from the compose file replaces the baked string, and what that silently removes is not only the
# heap ceiling: it is the `-Dcomposeai.cli.lib*Dir` flags that are the ONLY way the render lanes
# find their sidecars. They live at /opt/lib-*, which is neither $APP_HOME (the start script does
# not export it) nor a classpath-relative path, so nothing else can locate them.
#
# The failure that produces is silent and reads like a content problem: catalogs still serve, still
# render, still look right — they just quietly stop offering live device/theme/knob controls, with
# `livebundle-unavailable` naming a daemon that "could not be started". preview.coo.ee ran that way
# with a stale JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS carrying the Android flag alone: every Android catalog was live and
# every desktop one was snapshots, which looks exactly like a desktop-lane bug and is not one.
#
# So: add back any sidecar flag that is missing AND whose directory this image actually has. Only
# missing ones — an operator who points a flag at their own sidecar keeps it, which is the whole
# reason this appends per-flag rather than re-appending the baked string wholesale.
#
# `libBtaDir` is in the list for the same mechanical reason and a different symptom: it is not a
# render lane at all but the PLAYGROUND's compiler, and losing it disables that lane outright
# ("playground compiler unavailable — no lib-bta/ in the CLI install") on a box that otherwise
# admits it. Same silent shape — a configured feature that simply is not there.
#
# `libRcjvmDir` is the third symptom and the loudest, which is exactly why it was missed here: the
# `cmp-jvm` render lane answers a visible 503 ("needs lib-rcjvm and lib-daemon-desktop on the CLI
# install") rather than degrading quietly, so it reads as a broken player rather than as a lost
# flag. The flag is baked and paired in the Dockerfile like every other, and was the one this
# stanza never re-asserted.

# The directories are variables so the guard test can point them at fixtures; they default to the
