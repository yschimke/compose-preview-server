# Agent access grants

**Status:** implemented (`compose-preview serve --agent-grants`, `compose-preview auth …`)

## The problem

`compose-preview serve` protects itself two ways, and an agent can satisfy neither.

- A private box is **token-gated**: every route runs through `rejectBadToken`, which wants
  `--token`'s value in `?token=` or `X-Compose-Preview-Token`. Handing that to an agent hands over
  the whole server, forever, in a string that then lives in the agent's transcript.
- A public box is **GitHub-gated**: live preview wants a signed-in visitor
  (`rejectMissingGithubAuth`), the playground additionally wants access to `--github-auth-repo`
  (`rejectMissingGithubRepoAccess`). Both are cookie sessions minted by an interactive OAuth
  redirect. An agent has no browser to be redirected in, and asking a human to paste their session
  cookie is worse than the token.

So the practical answer today is "paste the operator token into the agent's context", which is a
permanent, unscoped, unrevocable, unattributable credential. That is the thing this replaces.

## The shape

The [OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant (RFC 8628)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8628),
narrowed to this server. It is exactly the right shape and for exactly the reason it was invented:
the party that needs the credential cannot render the authorization page, so it asks for a **link**
that someone who *can* render it will open.

```

The agent then presents that token the same way the operator token is presented — `?token=` or
`X-Compose-Preview-Token` — so **no route changes shape**. The four existing gates learn one new
way to say yes.

## Why the token is not in the link

This is the design's load-bearing property, and it is the reason the flow has two secrets rather
than one.

The link is going to be pasted into a chat window, a terminal, an issue comment, a Slack DM. It will
be logged by something. If the link *were* the credential, every one of those is a compromise.

So the link carries only `requestId` — a public handle. The token is delivered on the **poll** leg,
to whoever proves possession of `deviceSecret`, which never leaves the agent's process except in the
body of a POST to the server that minted it. A leaked link therefore buys an attacker nothing they
can use: the worst they can do is *approve* a request whose token is then handed to the agent that
asked for it, which is the outcome the human wanted anyway.

That is also why approval is a `POST`, never a `GET` with a magic query parameter. A link-unfurler,
a prefetcher, a corporate mail scanner, or an over-helpful chat client fetching the URL to build a
preview card must not be able to grant access by looking at it.

## Why there is a user code

`userCode` (`WXYZ-1234`) is printed by the agent *and* displayed on the approval page, and the human
is told to check that they match.

Without it the flow has a real hole: an attacker who can get a message in front of the operator
sends *their own* approval link, styled as the agent's. The operator, who is genuinely expecting to
approve something right now, clicks it and approves — and the attacker's poller collects the token.
The code closes it, because the attacker cannot make the agent's terminal print the attacker's code.
This is the same control, for the same reason, as the one on a TV's sign-in screen.

## Why a dead grant says which kind of dead

`GET /agent-access/whoami` answers an inactive credential with a `reason` and a human-readable
`message`, not merely `active: false`. An agent whose calls start failing has to choose between
retrying, re-running the approval flow, and stopping because a human revoked it — and those are
very different responses to what used to be one indistinguishable empty reply.

| `reason` | Means |
|---|---|
| `absent` | no credential on the request |
| `malformed` | not shaped like a grant token |
| `expired` | known here, past its TTL |
| `unknown` | revoked, **or** issued by a previous run of this server |

`unknown` deliberately conflates revocation with a restart. Nothing in the store is persisted, so a
redeploy invalidates every outstanding token, and telling the two apart would mean keeping a
tombstone for every revoked token — retaining exactly what revocation is meant to discard. The
message names both causes so the reader can tell which happened from context the server does not
have.

## Scopes, and the ceiling on them

Three, ordered, each implying the ones below:

| Scope        | Unlocks                                             | Gate it satisfies                |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `preview`    | browse catalogs, fetch baked renders, `/status`     | `rejectBadToken`                 |
| `live`       | live daemon streaming, the viewer WebSocket         | `rejectMissingGithubAuth`        |
| `playground` | compile and run a snippet on the box                | `rejectMissingGithubRepoAccess`  |

Two details of *how* those gates read a grant are load-bearing rather than incidental.

**Scope is checked before, and independently of, whether GitHub auth exists.** Written the other way
round — `githubAuth ?: return false` first — a private box with no OAuth configured let every grant
through the live and playground gates unread, because those gates had nothing else to say. A
presented grant is now judged on its own scope on every deployment shape, and a grant that falls
short gets a 403 naming the scope it lacks rather than a sign-in redirect it has no browser for.

**A route that commissions a render wants `live`, even when it looks like a read.**
`/render/{id}.png` replays baked bytes — until an override query or a non-PNG suffix turns it into
an on-demand daemon render, and `/bundle.zip` renders the whole catalog. Those are the CPU cost
`live` exists to describe, so they check the scope themselves; a bare replay stays `preview`,
because refusing it would break ordinary browsing for a grant that was given exactly that.

**A capability is not a rung, and is chosen separately.** Scope answers *how much of this machine
may the agent spend*; some permissions are not on that ladder at all. `images` is the one that
exists: uploading a PNG through the [image lane](../public-preview-server.md#uploading-a-preview-image---accept-images)
is not "more" than starting a render daemon and not "less" than compiling a snippet — it is sideways
from both. As a fourth rung it would have made every `playground` grant an uploader and every
uploader a daemon-starter, so it is a **set** beside the scope
([`ServeAgentGrantCapability`](../../cli/serve/src/main/kotlin/ee/schimke/composeai/cli/serve/ServeAgentGrantCapability.kt))
rather than a value on it, with its own operator ceiling (`--agent-grant-capabilities`, default
empty) and its own checkbox on the approval page. Radios for the ladder, checkboxes for the set:
independent boxes describe independent permissions honestly, and nothing is pre-ticked.

What the image lane then accepts is a grant carrying `images` **instead of** a GitHub credential,
and the argument is that a grant says something stronger than the credential it replaces. The lane's
GitHub check asks *does this account have write access to the gating repo* — a proxy for "is this
person trusted here". A grant answers *a human operator of this box approved this specific agent,
for these minutes, and their name is on it*. So attribution improves rather than degrades:
`uploadedBy` reads `agent grant 682daf65 (approved by @yschimke)`, which is more than a login and
names the human who said yes. The rate-limit bucket is the grant, not an address or a login, because
a grant is already the bounded thing.

Three edges are worth stating, since none of them is obvious:

1. **The approver must hold it themselves.** On a GitHub-gated box, ticking `images` requires the
   approver's own session to carry `repositoryAccess` — the identical rule, and the identical
   `repositoryAccess` bit, that governs `playground`. Someone who could not upload cannot mint a
   token that can. That bit speaks for `--github-auth-repo` and nothing else, so a box whose image
   lane gates on a **different** repository is refused this capability at startup: the verdict a
   session carries would not be about the repository the upload actually publishes to, and
   approximating it is how "the approver must hold it" quietly becomes false.
2. **A capability for a lane the box does not run is refused at startup.** `--agent-grant-capabilities
   images` without `--accept-images` fails `serve` rather than offering a checkbox whose grant would
   404 on a route that was never registered.
3. **Revoking a grant does not unpublish what it uploaded.** The grant dies in minutes; the image
   link lives for `--image-ttl` (7 days by default), because the upload was authorized when it
   happened. An operator who needs the picture gone needs the image lane's own controls, not the
   revoke button.

**The other ingest lanes are outside the scope system entirely.** `POST /bundles/{name}` and `POST /docs`
run through the same `rejectBadToken` as everything else, so a `preview` grant would have satisfied
them — letting an agent granted "browse this server's catalogs" publish a document or replace a
named runtime bundle. They take [`rejectBadTokenForIngest`](../../cli/serve/src/main/kotlin/ee/schimke/composeai/cli/serve/ServeHttpServer.kt)
instead, which no grant satisfies. Contributing content to someone else's box is the operator's
business, not a capability this flow should be able to hand out; the image lane already worked this
way for its own reasons.

Two ceilings apply, and both are enforced at approval rather than at request:

1. **The operator's ceiling** — `--agent-grant-scopes`, default `preview,live`. `playground` runs
   attacker-chosen Kotlin on the host, so it is never in a default grant; an operator who wants
   agents to reach it says so once, on the command line.
2. **The approver's ceiling** — an approver can never grant what they do not themselves hold. On a
   GitHub-gated box, approving `playground` requires the approver's own session to carry
   `repositoryAccess`; without it the checkbox is disabled and a forged POST is refused.

A request asks for scopes; the approval page is where they are actually chosen. The human may
approve less than was asked for, and the page defaults to exactly what was asked for so the ordinary
case is one click.

## Who may approve

An approver must be a **human operator of this box**, and that is checked in two parts, both of
which have to pass:

1. **The server's own front door.** On a non-`--public` box the approver must present `--token`. A
   GitHub session is *not* a substitute for it: on a private box that also configures OAuth, any
   account the (by default empty) `--github-auth-users` allowlist accepts could otherwise open an
   ungated request, sign in at its own approval URL, and mint itself a grant into a server whose
   browse token it never had.
2. **An identity, where there is one to have.** GitHub auth configured ⇒ a signed-in visitor,
   recorded by login, so `/status` and the server log say *who* let the agent in. No GitHub auth ⇒
   the `--token` holder from step 1, recorded as `operator (token)`.

Neither part can be satisfied by an agent grant — a GitHub session lives in a cookie no agent holds,
and the token compare is against `--token` specifically, which no minted bearer can equal. So a
grant can never approve or revoke another.

A `--public` server with **no** GitHub auth has neither part: everyone is anonymous, and there is no
front door to pass. `--agent-grants` is refused at startup there rather than silently letting the
internet mint itself credentials.

## Lifetime, revocation, blast radius

- **Request TTL** 10 minutes. A link nobody opens dies quickly.
- **Grant TTL** requested by the agent, capped by `--agent-grant-max-ttl` (default 8h, hard ceiling
  24h). Chosen by the approver on the page, so "give it 20 minutes" is available without the agent
  re-asking.
- **Revocation** from `/status` (one button per live grant), by the agent itself
  (`POST /agent-access/revoke`), and implicitly at expiry.
- **Bounded** — `--agent-grant-max-active` (default 16) live grants, nearest-expiry evicted first
  *excluding the one just minted* (an approver choosing a short lifetime on a full box would
  otherwise evict the grant the page had just reported as approved). Requests are bounded too, and
  shed only once denied or collected — an approval nobody has polled for yet still owes its owner a
  credential. The store is in memory, so a restart drops every grant. That is deliberate: the
  TTLs are short, and a credential that cannot survive a redeploy has a much smaller worst case than
  one that can.
- **Never printed.** The token appears exactly once, in the poll response. `/status`, the server log,
  and every error message carry only a fingerprint (`sha256` prefix). The audit line names the
  approver, the label, the scopes, the expiry, and that fingerprint.

## What it is not

- **Not a session.** No cookies, no refresh, no sliding expiry. It ends when it ends.
- **Not an identity.** A grant does not become a GitHub login. Where it now admits an upload
  (`images`, above) it does so **as itself** — the audit line and `uploadedBy` name the grant and its
  approver, never a GitHub account — and it confers nothing anywhere else that a login would.
- **Not admin.** `--admin-token` routes are outside every scope. Nothing an agent can be granted
  reconfigures the box.

## Waiting for the decision

`POST /agent-access/poll` answers immediately by default — `pending`, with a `retryAfterSeconds` —
which is RFC 8628's shape and exactly right for a shell loop, where a `sleep` costs nothing.

It is wrong for an agent. Over MCP every poll is a **tool call through a model**: a human who takes
half a minute to find the tab costs a dozen round trips, each with its own latency and tokens, for
an answer that did not change. So the poll accepts an optional `waitSeconds` (clamped to 30) and
holds the request open, answering the moment somebody approves or denies. One call instead of a
dozen, and the human's click feels instant rather than landing up to three seconds early.

- **Absent or zero is the old behaviour**, unchanged, so an interval poller keeps working.
- **A wait that times out answers what an immediate poll would have** — `pending`, same retry
  interval — so a caller that gives up is where it would have been anyway.
- **Only `pending` waits.** `unknown` in particular answers at once: it is what a wrong device
  secret gets, and holding those open would turn guessing at a secret into a way to occupy a
  connection.
- **Waiting spends one permit, not one per second.** The caller holds the rate limiter's permit for
  the whole wait, which is the same budget an interval poller burns through much faster.

The MCP tool defaults to waiting rather than to spinning, since a client that says nothing is a
client that would otherwise call again in three seconds, through a model. Its default is **8
seconds, not the 30 second maximum**: a held call only helps if the client holds it too, and a
conservative HTTP client gives up sooner than this lane would like — OkHttp's default read timeout
is 10s. A default that outlives the caller's timeout turns a latency improvement into a transport
error, which is strictly worse than answering `pending`.

## Asking through MCP

The catalog MCP endpoint (`/mcp`) carries the same two legs as tools, `request_access` and
`poll_access`, so a client whose only transport is MCP can bootstrap itself. They are thin wrappers:
the same request and poll bodies documented above, produced by the same code, charged to the same
per-address budget. Nothing about the design changes — the link is still a handle, the token still
rides the poll leg to whoever holds the device secret, and a human still approves in a browser.

What did change is the gate. MCP used to authorize the whole endpoint before parsing, so a client
holding nothing could not complete `initialize` and therefore could not reach a tool that asks for a
credential; the flow existed and was unreachable from the transport that needed it most. The gate is
now asked per message: the handshake, `tools/list` and these two tools are open, everything that
reads a catalog is not, and an unrecognised method or tool name is gated by default. See
[the catalog MCP guide](CATALOG_MCP.md#or-ask-from-inside-the-protocol).

It is also how a client recovers from a restart. Nothing here is persisted — deliberately, see
above — so a redeployed host invalidates every live bearer at once, and an agent mid-task meets a
401 with plenty of TTL left on a token that no longer exists. Asking again is the whole remedy, and
now it costs no out-of-band tooling.

## Client side

`compose-preview auth` drives the agent's half:

```
compose-preview auth request --server https://preview.coo.ee \
    --scope live --ttl 2h --label "fix wear-m3-catalog#68"
compose-preview auth request --server https://preview.coo.ee \
    --capability images --label "embed before/after in the PR body"
compose-preview auth status
compose-preview auth token      # prints the bearer, for scripting
compose-preview auth revoke
```

`request` prints the link and the code, then blocks on the poll until the human approves, and stores
the granted token in `~/.config/compose-preview/agent-access.json` (mode `0600`), keyed by server
origin. Every other CLI lane that talks to a serve host resolves its host token from
`--token` → `$COMPOSE_PREVIEW_TOKEN` → that store, so once a grant lands the rest of the CLI simply
starts working.

The store is written through a temp file and an atomic rename, under an advisory lock on a sibling
`.lock`. Both halves matter with more than one agent on a machine: without the lock two runs
finishing together each read the old list and the later writer drops the other's freshly approved
grant; without the atomic replace a concurrent reader can see a half-written file, report it as
empty, and then overwrite it.

**`--no-wait` persists the request** — the id, the device secret, the link and the code — so a later
`auth status` (or `auth token`) polls it and promotes the approval into a grant. Without that the
printed "re-run auth status when they approve" was an instruction nobody could follow: the device
secret is the only thing that can redeem an approval, and it had been thrown away. It is saved
before anything is printed, so an interrupted wait is recoverable too.

**`auth status` asks the server rather than trusting the file.** It collects any remembered request,
and verifies each stored grant with `whoami`: one the operator revoked, or one that died with a
server restart, is reported as gone and dropped instead of being listed as live until its local
expiry and then failing somewhere else with an unexplained 404. A server it cannot reach yields
`unverified`, never a deletion — an unreachable host is not evidence that a grant is dead.

**`--json` is JSON Lines**, one compact document per line. A waiting `auth request --json` emits two
— the request, so the link can be relayed immediately, and the grant once it lands — and two
pretty-printed objects concatenated would not parse as anything.
