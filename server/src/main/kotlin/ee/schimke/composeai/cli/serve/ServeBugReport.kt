package ee.schimke.composeai.cli.serve

/**
 * Builds the prefilled GitHub **new-issue** report for a bug in the **preview server itself** — the
 * running `compose-preview serve` process, its render lanes, and the web UI it draws — as opposed
 * to [ServeIssueReport], which files a bug about a *preview* against the repo whose Kotlin declares
 * it.
 *
 * **Why the two are separate rather than one affordance with a repo switch.** They differ in every
 * dimension that matters. [ServeIssueReport] targets a repo it has to *derive* (the catalog's
 * source, else its delivery repo, else a fallback), and the facts it carries identify a preview —
 * component, variant, reference, overrides — because that is what a catalog maintainer needs to
 * reproduce a wrong-looking button. This one always targets [REPO], because there is exactly one
 * repo that ships the server, and the facts it carries describe a *deployment*: which build is
 * running, on which JVM and OS, in which posture, with which catalogs loaded or failed, and what
 * the render lanes have been doing. A visitor whose knob does nothing, whose render 500s, or whose
 * page draws wrong is looking at a server bug, and routing that into the catalog's issue tracker
 * sends it to people who cannot fix it. Making one report try to be both would mean a body that is
 * half-empty whichever bug it is.
 *
 * **Why the affordance is server-wide rather than per-preview.** The per-preview report hangs off a
 * preview because that is its subject. A server bug has no such anchor — the page that misbehaved
 * may be the front door, `/status`, or a catalog that failed to load and has no viewer at all — so
 * this one rides in the site footer on every page, beside the build number it is a bug in.
 *
 * **Why a prefilled link and not a server-side filing**, and **why a form rather than an anchor**:
 * both for the reasons written up on [ServeIssueReport] — the server holds no issue-write token by
 * design, and writing page state into an `href` is a navigation sink. The same [ServeIssueReport]
 * helpers are reused here rather than reimplemented, so a token can't leak into one report body
 * after being stripped from the other.
