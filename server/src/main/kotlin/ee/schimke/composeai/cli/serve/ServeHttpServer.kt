/**
 * The embedded Ktor (CIO) HTTP server fronting a [ServeSessionRegistry]. Thin IO shell: a token
 * gate, the routes, and the query-param → [ServeOverrides] → render → PNG glue. All shared,
 * concurrency-safe state lives in the per-tenant [ServeRenderHost]s; this class adds none of its
 * own per-request state, so it serves any number of clients.
 *
 * **Multi-tenant:** one server fronts many sessions instead of one per module. Every route resolves
 * a [ServeRenderHost] from the registry by the request's `?session=` (falling back to
 * [defaultSessionId]); the registry forks the tenant behind its factory on first use. Unknown
 * sessions 404 like a bad token.
 *
 * Endpoints (all token-gated except `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/version`, and the `/wasm/` and
 * `/ui-builder/` static assets):
 * - `GET /` landing page, `GET /p/{id}` viewer page,
 * - `GET /{system}/feed.xml` demand-activated catalog change feed,
 * - `GET /render/{id}.png` PNG bytes, `GET /api/previews` JSON, `GET /healthz` liveness,
 * - `GET /hero/{system}/{hash}.png` a prebaked, immutable front-door thumbnail ([ServeHeroImages]),
 * - `GET /social/{hash}.png` the drawn link-unfurl card a page advertises ([ServeSocialCard]), and
 *   `GET /favicon.svg` / `/favicon.ico` / `/apple-touch-icon.png` the site icon ([ServeSiteIcon]) —
 *   all ungated, because a link unfurler presents no token when it fetches what a page pointed it
 *   at, and an icon fetcher never presents one at all,
 * - `GET /readyz` readiness (green only after a representative preview actually renders — the
 *   rolling-update gate),
 * - `GET /index.json` Storybook stories index, `GET /iframe.html?id=` isolated story render
 *   (`&format=svg` serves the vector export as an inert SVG image for DOM-capture tools),
 *   ([StorybookCompat]) — the drop-in surface downstream Storybook visual tools consume,
 * - `GET /version` host identity (CLI version, serve schema, public flag),
 * - `GET /bundle.zip` portable bundle, `WS /ws/{id}` streamed-frame lane.
 *
 * A bad/missing token returns **404** (not 401) so the server's existence isn't confirmed to a
 * scanner; the token is compared in constant time ([ServeUrls.tokensMatch]).

   *    answers a neighbour's `/{system}/…` with its own 404 on purpose, so a sibling reachable from
   *    `m3.example.test` is precisely what a site exists not to be;
   * 2. this catalog declares a `compareWith` system;
   * 3. this preview belongs to a component that declares a `parallel`;
   * 4. the sibling is served on THIS host (a pairing with a system we do not host is a fact about
   *    the spec, not a link we can offer);
   * 5. the sibling has a preview for that component id.
   *
   * [ServeSessionRegistry.peekHost], never `lease`: this is a metadata read while building a page,
   * and standing a suspended sibling's daemon up to decide whether to draw a button would be a
   * daemon per page view. A suspended sibling therefore offers no lane — fail-soft, like the rest

   * - the preview is **replayed** from a captured Remote Compose document rather than recomposed,
   *   so a `knob.*` (and a string `rc.*`) has no composition to reach, even though the host renders
   *   perfectly well. [CatalogLiveRouting.irReplayDroppedOverrideNames] is the authority on that
   *   set, and asking it — rather than a host-wide capability — is what keeps this guard and the
   *   render lane's own refusal ([droppedOverridesFor]) answering the same question.

   * [ServeWeb.componentSearchEntries] filters, groups and sorts the whole preview list and then
   * makes a second grouping pass for duplicate labels; `designToolLabel` walks every preview and

   * rebuilding this for 27 catalogs whose published contents had not moved.

   * Deliberately does **not** cover the members that move while a host is resident — the theme
   * optimization and render-cache snapshots (progress counters, read by `/status`), the hero's
   * baked render size, the hero's content crop and the hero thumbnail itself (a catalog fills its
   * images in after it loads, which is why [ServeHeroImages] memoises a decode failure but never a
   * missing PNG, and why [ServeBundleHost.contentCrop] memoises only a decision it could settle

   *
   * `.json` is accepted as an **alias** so the path reads like the machine artifact it mirrors; the
   * bare id answers identically. Resolved by trying the name VERBATIM first and only then the
   * stripped form, because a preview id is unrestricted path-segment data and may itself end in
   * `.json` — unconditional suffix removal would answer such a preview with a 404, or worse, with
   * the index belonging to a different preview whose id is the stripped form. Neither form
   * re-renders: this reads the catalog's `tags/index.json` through [ServeHost.tagIndexForPreview]
   * and nothing else, which is exactly why it needs no live-scope gate and can be served from a
   * static bundle.
   *
   * **An empty index is `{}`, not a 404.** "This preview carries no tags" and "this server cannot
   * tell you" are different answers, and a consumer that cannot distinguish them has no way to
   * choose between offering no tag targets and offering none *yet*. A preview this session does not
   * serve at all is the 404.
   *
   * ## What this route does NOT establish
   *
   * That the index describes the frame the caller is looking at. It is the *published static*
   * index, computed in CI over the baked render, and both live host wrappers delegate
   * [ServeHost.tagIndexForPreview] to their baked host — so an override-bearing or pinned frame is
   * a different render than the one these bounds were measured on. Tag-derived selection therefore
   * has to be gated on the frame being the baked one ([ServeWeb.ReferenceComparison.tagSelection],
   * decided by the page that knows which frame it is showing). Recording bounds from another frame
   * into an acceptance is worse than having no element gate: it reports an element that never moved
   * as moved, with a plausible explanation attached.
   *
   * That gate is now paired with a **generation** one ([ServeCacheGeneration]): a caller may name
   * the publish it is asking about, and this route refuses one the catalog has moved on from rather
   * than answering with today's bounds. It cannot answer for an older publish — the index is read
   * from the catalog on disk and the branch publishes no per-revision copy — so refusing is the
   * whole of what it can honestly do, and it is enough: the pair is one publish or there is no
