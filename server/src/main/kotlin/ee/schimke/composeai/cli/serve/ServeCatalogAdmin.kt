/**
 * Publish and retire catalogs on a **running** server, and persist the result.
 *
 * The catalog set used to be a startup-only decision: a comma-separated flag the container
 * entrypoint baked in, so adding a catalog meant editing the image's compose file and recreating
 * the container. This is the runtime half of making it config ([ServeCatalogsConfig]) — the admin
 * API's `POST`/`DELETE` land here, which:
 * 1. validates the entry (id/repo shape, unknown group, duplicate system),
 * 2. fetches + registers (or unregisters) the catalog through the same [ServeCatalogStore] path
 *    startup uses, so a runtime catalog is in every way an ordinary one,
 * 3. records it in the [CatalogLoadTracker] — the configured-set source of truth the home index,
 *    `/status`, and the branch refresher all read, so the change is visible everywhere at once,
 * 4. rewrites the operator's `catalogs.json` so it survives a restart.
 *
 * Persistence is best-effort and reported, never fatal: a registration that worked but couldn't be
 * written back is still serving, and says so, rather than being rolled back.
