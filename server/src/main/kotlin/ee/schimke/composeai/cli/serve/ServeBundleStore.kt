/**
 * Runtime ingestion of **client-provided** portable bundles for the shared/public mode: a client
 * uploads a bundle zip (or points at a URL of one — a CI "build results" artifact), and the store
 * unpacks it and registers a read-only [ServeBundleHost] session via [register]. This is what makes
 * a deployed public server useful without it building anything: clients contribute pre-rendered
 * results and get a shareable `?session=<name>` link back.
 *
 * Safety: only the servable `previews/` entries are extracted — the baked `<id>.png` images, the
 * per-preview knob sidecars (`<id>.overrides.json` / `<id>.remotecompose.json`), and the root
 * `previews.json` manifest; everything else in the zip is ignored — each written under a per-bundle
 * directory with a zip-slip containment check, and the total extracted size is capped. The URL case
 * ([addFromUrl]) is an **SSRF** surface — a public server fetching arbitrary URLs could be steered
 * at internal metadata/services — so it is gated by [allowedHosts]: only a URL whose host is on
 * that operator-supplied allowlist is fetched, and an empty allowlist refuses every URL (fail
 * closed). [fetch] is injected so it can be stubbed in tests; the host gate runs in [addFromUrl]
 * regardless of which fetcher is wired.
