package ee.schimke.composeai.cli.serve

/**
 * **Top-level sites**: a catalog this server already publishes at `/<system>/`, additionally
 * reachable on a hostname of its own where it looks like the only thing on the box — e.g.
 * `m3.preview.coo.ee` serving what `preview.coo.ee/m3-catalog/` serves.
 *
 * This is deliberately a **view**, not a second deployment. The same [ServeSessionRegistry]
 * session, the same baked pixels, the same daemon (if any), the same hero/social/asset caches: a
 * site host costs one map lookup on the request and changes nothing about what the server does with
 * the request afterwards. Adding a site adds no catalog, no render, no memory. What it changes is
 * only what the request *resolves to* and what the pages *say*:
 *
 * - the site's system is the session, so the root-mounted routes (`/`, `/p/<id>`, `/render/<id>`,
 *   `/api/previews`, …) — which already exist for the legacy `?session=` form — answer for it;
 * - links are built with an **empty** base path, so every href stays on the custom domain rather
 *   than pointing back at `preview.coo.ee/<system>/`;
 * - the front-door index, the "← All design systems" back button and the cross-system nav are
 *   suppressed, so the site doesn't advertise its neighbours;
 * - `/status`, `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml` are scoped to this one system.
 *
 * The canonical `/<system>/` form is still served on the *main* host; on a site host it redirects
 * to the root form so the two spellings don't compete for indexing, and another system's path 404s
 * rather than quietly serving a neighbour under the wrong domain.
 *
 * Nothing here grants access: a site can only name a system this server is already configured to
 * serve, and every route stays behind the same token/public gate it always was.
