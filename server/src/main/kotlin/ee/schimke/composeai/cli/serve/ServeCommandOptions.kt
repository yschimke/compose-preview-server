      compose-preview serve [options]

      Start a local HTTP server that renders one module's @Preview functions on demand and serves
      them as PNGs with display overrides, so you can open (or share) a link to a specific preview.
      Read-only today; bound to loopback unless you opt into LAN exposure.

      Options:
        --module <path>   Module to serve, scoping local Gradle discovery + build to it. Implies
                          --discover. Omit it (and --discover) to run module-less — see below.
        --discover        Opt in to local Gradle discovery + build. By default serve NEVER runs
                          Gradle: it hosts only the fetched --bundle(s) / --catalogs / uploaded
                          bundles as a pure preview server, even inside a Gradle checkout (so a
                          stray `serve` at a repo root can't trigger a full — possibly hanging —
                          module build). Pass --discover to build every module's previews and host
                          one, or --module <path> to scope to a single module.
        --bundle <url|path>[, --bundle <name>=<url|path>, …]
                          Serve one or more fetched preview bundles directly — no --module, no
                          build. A URL is fetched at startup (operator-supplied, so no SSRF gate;
                          e.g. a raw.githubusercontent.com/<owner>/<repo>/<branch>/… link); a local
                          path is read. Each is served at /<name>/. A bundle that verifies Trusted
                          (Ed25519 signature, or fetched from a trusted branch in --trust-store) is
                          served LIVE from a render daemon when --allow-render-trusted is set
                          (desktop bundles); otherwise read-only as its baked PNGs. Repeatable.
        --id <exact>      Only serve this exact preview id.
        --filter <substr> Only serve previews whose id contains this substring.
        --preview <ref>   Only serve previews the reference selects: an id, a
                          `Class.function`, a bare function name, or a case-insensitive
                          substring of an id. Combined with --id / --filter it intersects:
                          every selector you pass has to match. Selecting needs a module
                          (--module / --discover) — a bundle-backed server has no manifest.
        --host <addr>     Bind address (default 127.0.0.1 — loopback only).
        --lan             Bind all interfaces (0.0.0.0) so other devices on your network can
                          connect. Prints the token-gated network URL and a security warning.
        --port <n>        Preferred port (default ${ServeDefaults.DEFAULT_PORT}; auto-picks the next free one).
        --token <value>   Use a fixed token instead of a freshly generated one (stable links).
        --public          Serve every route WITHOUT a token (open). For a deployed public preview
                          server — browsing published catalogs / uploaded bundles is the point. Safe
                          by construction (no server-side code exec; untrusted re-render refused;
                          uploads capped + SSRF-gated). Off by default.
        --component-browser
                          Use the streamlined Storybook-like catalog and component browser. Hides
                          administration, diagnostics, comparison and renderer tooling while
                          retaining visual navigation, variants, themes, authored controls,
                          sample source, locale/font scale and PNG/SVG downloads.
        --github-auth-client-id <id>
        --github-auth-client-secret <secret>
        --github-auth-cookie-secret <secret>
        --github-auth-repo <owner/repo>
                          Add GitHub OAuth on top of the browse gate for code-running surfaces:
                          live preview WebSockets and the playground. Live preview accepts any
                          signed-in GitHub user (unless --github-auth-users narrows sign-in);
                          playground additionally requires access to <owner/repo>. After sign-in
                          the server stores only a signed, expiring login cookie plus the repo
                          access verdict. The OAuth scope follows the repo's visibility: a public
                          <owner/repo> needs only read:user, a private one also needs repo (classic
                          OAuth apps have no read-only repository scope). All four flags are
                          required together.
        --github-auth-callback-base-url <url>
                          External origin for the OAuth callback, e.g. https://preview.example.com.
                          Omit for local use; reverse-proxied deploys should set it explicitly.
        --github-auth-cookie-domain <domain>
                          Scope the auth cookies to a parent domain, so one sign-in covers it and
                          every --sites hostname under it (preview.example.com also signs in
                          m3.preview.example.com). Required for sign-in to work on a top-level site
                          when --github-auth-callback-base-url is pinned: without it the cookies are
                          host-only, the state cookie never reaches the callback origin, and the
                          server withholds sign-in on site hosts. Omit on a single-hostname box.
                          Every host under <domain> is inside the session's reach, so name the
                          narrowest one that covers your sites.
        --github-auth-scope <scope>
                          Override the OAuth scope instead of deriving it from --github-auth-repo's
                          visibility. Only needed when a GitHub App or org policy demands a specific
                          one; the derived value is already the narrowest that works.
        --github-auth-users <login>[,<login>…]
                          Optional sign-in allowlist. Empty means any signed-in GitHub user may use
                          live sessions; playground still requires access to --github-auth-repo.
        --agent-grants    Let an agent ask for temporary access it can't otherwise get. The agent
                          POSTs /agent-access/request and prints a link plus a verification code;
                          you open the link, check the code matches, and approve. It then collects a
                          short-lived bearer token scoped to what you ticked. Approving requires a
                          signed-in GitHub user (with --github-auth-*) or the --token holder; a
                          --public server with neither is refused. Revoke any time from /status.
                          Off by default.
        --catalog-mcp     Expose all catalogs at /mcp using stateless Streamable HTTP.
                          Requires --agent-grants. Published reads need preview scope; made-to-order
                          renders and data products need live scope. Separate from UI-builder MCP.
        --agent-grant-scopes <list>
                          Ceiling on what a grant may carry: preview, live, playground (cumulative;
                          default preview,live). 'playground' lets an approved agent compile and run
                          Kotlin on this host, and can only be approved by someone who has access to
                          --github-auth-repo themselves.
        --agent-grant-capabilities <list>
                          Extra permissions a grant may carry beside its scope, chosen separately by
                          the approver: currently 'images' (upload rendered previews through the
                          image lane, needs --accept-images). Off by default — a scope ceiling says
                          nothing about these.
        --agent-grant-max-ttl <duration>
                          Longest grant this server will mint, e.g. 90m / 2h / 3600 (default 8h,
                          hard ceiling 24h). The approver picks the actual lifetime on the page.
        --agent-grant-max-active <n>
                          Live grants allowed at once (default ${ServeDefaults.AGENT_GRANT_MAX_ACTIVE}); a new one evicts the
                          nearest to expiry.
        --agent-grant-rate-limit <n>
                          Requests per minute per address on the two ungated grant routes (default
                          ${ServeDefaults.DEFAULT_AGENT_GRANT_RATE_LIMIT}; 0 disables the budget entirely).
        --export <path>   Don't serve: render every preview once and write a portable bundle (a
                          self-contained web gallery + PNGs) to <path>. A '.zip' path writes a zip;
                          any other path writes a directory. The live server also offers this at
                          GET /bundle.zip.
        --inline          With --export, bake the PNGs into the gallery for a single self-contained
                          index.html (vs. separate previews/<id>.png files).
        --revisions       Project mode: also serve other git revisions of this repo on demand. A
                          request with ?session=<rev> checks that revision out into a worktree,
                          builds it, and serves it as its own session (suspended/resumed when idle).
        --history-branch <ref>
                          Project mode: the baseline delivery branch, as fetched in this checkout,
                          whose publishes the viewer's render-history strip is built from (default
                          ${ServeDefaults.HISTORY_BRANCH}; 'origin/<ref>' is tried too). Each
                          entry opens that version's render, served from the local object store.
                          A ref this clone can't resolve simply means no strip.
        --no-history      Don't compute the render-history strip from local git.
        --revisions-allow <ref>[,<ref>…]
                          Project mode SECURITY gate: only revisions reachable from these trusted
                          refs (e.g. main,release) are checked out and built — building runs that
                          revision's own Gradle (code execution). Omitted/empty = nothing builds
                          (fail closed), so arbitrary ?session=<rev> can't run code on the server.
                          Also gates --allow-render-trusted (the catalog source ref allowlist).
        --allow-render-trusted
                          SECURITY gate, opt-in (default off): serve a --catalogs catalog that is
                          Trusted AND declares a source as a live, re-renderable session built from
                          that source (full-fidelity overrides) instead of static baked PNGs. Runs
                          the source's Gradle = code execution, so it's gated by trust + the
                          --revisions-allow ref allowlist + a same-repo check. NEVER set this on a
                          box that can't build the catalog source (e.g. the desktop-only public
                          image can't build the Android catalogs) — leave it off and let the
                          in-browser Wasm tier carry CMP.
        --catalog-source-root <dir>
                          Git repo root the trusted-catalog builder (--allow-render-trusted)
                          worktrees + builds from, instead of the served --module's own project. Use
                          when the server is module-less but the catalog's source.repo is a separate
                          checkout (e.g. a prebuilt image that clones the CMP catalog repo for live
                          render). The trust + same-repo + ref-allowlist gates are unchanged.
        --live-seats <n>  Live (daemon-backed) stream PERMIT BUDGET. Each live session charges permits
                          by backend weight — a desktop CMP daemon costs 1, a heavier Robolectric
                          Android one costs 2 — so one heavy catalog can't hog a flat seat count and
                          starve the cheap CMP lanes. On a small box bound this (e.g. 2) when the live
                          tier is on (--allow-render-trusted); an over-budget stream is refused (WS
                          1013) rather than risking the OOM killer. Default 0 = unbounded. Snapshot +
                          Wasm sessions never take a permit.
        --exit-when-idle[=<seconds>]
                          Ephemeral mode: shut the server down once it's been idle (no open
                          connections and no requests) for <seconds> (default ${ServeDefaults.DEFAULT_IDLE_EXIT_SECONDS}s). Use a small
                          value to exit shortly after the last client disconnects.
        --bundles <dir>   Shared mode: also host pre-rendered portable bundles (no build/daemon). A
                          bundle dir, or a directory of them, is served read-only — each reachable at
                          ?session=<bundle-name>. Bundles are what --export / GET /bundle.zip produce.
        --accept-bundles  Shared mode (public): enable POST /bundles/<name> so clients can contribute
                          bundles at runtime — upload the zip as the body, or pass ?url=<link> to a
                          build-results artifact. Pair with --lan + a strong --token for a shared
                          instance. Uploads only by default; ?url= fetches need --accept-bundles-from.
        --accept-bundles-from <host>[,<host>…]
                          SSRF allowlist for POST /bundles?url=: hostnames the server may fetch a
                          bundle from. Omitted/empty = no URL fetch is allowed (fail closed), so a
                          client can't steer the server at an arbitrary or internal address.
        --accept-docs     Enable the DOCUMENT lane: GET /docs (drop a file) + POST /docs ingest one
                          known document — Remote Compose (.rc) or Lottie (.json) — and hand back an
                          expiring permalink (/d/<id>) that plays it in the viewer's browser. Data
                          only: the server stores bytes and never renders them, so hosting an
                          anonymous document runs nothing. Off by default.
        --doc-ttl <seconds>
                          How long a /d/<id> document link lives (default ${ServeDefaults.DOC_TTL_SECONDS}s). The document is
                          held in memory and dropped when it expires.
        --accept-docs-from <host>[,<host>…]
                          SSRF allowlist for POST /docs?url=: hostnames the server may fetch a
                          document from. Omitted/empty = uploads only (fail closed).
        --accept-images   Enable the IMAGE lane: POST /images ingests a rendered preview (PNG, GIF,
                          WebP, JPEG) and answers with /i/<id>.png — a URL an agent can embed in a
                          pull-request body. Uploading is NEVER anonymous: it needs
                          "Authorization: Bearer <github-token>" from an account with access to
                          --image-upload-repo, on a --public host too. Reading is open, because
                          GitHub's image proxy fetches an embedded image anonymously; the 128-bit id
                          is the access control. Off by default.
        --image-upload-repo <owner/repo>
                          Repository an uploader must have access to. Defaults to --github-auth-repo
                          when that is set; without either, --accept-images refuses to start.
        --image-ttl <seconds>
                          How long a /i/<id> image link lives (default ${ServeDefaults.IMAGE_TTL_SECONDS}s = 7 days). Held in
                          memory and dropped when it expires; ${ServeDefaults.IMAGE_MAX_IMAGES} images / ${ServeDefaults.IMAGE_MAX_TOTAL_BYTES / (1024 * 1024)}MB max, the
                          oldest evicted first.
        --image-rate-limit <n>
                          Uploads per minute per GitHub account (default ${ServeDefaults.DEFAULT_IMAGE_RATE_LIMIT}). 0 disables the
                          budget.
        --trust-store <file>
                          Producer-trust allowlist (JSON: signing keys / branches / CI identities).
                          Uploaded bundles are verified against it and the verdict (signature /
                          branch / provenance / unverified) is returned + badged. Omitted = trust
                          nothing (every upload unverified); the data tiers serve either way.
        --catalogs <system>[@<owner>/<repo>][,…]
                          Serve our published design systems from their design-artifacts/<system>
                          branches (e.g. compose-m3,wear-m3): each is fetched (catalog.json + images)
                          and served read-only at /<system>/ (also ?session=<system>), listed on the
                          front-page nav, trusted-by-origin when the branch is in --trust-store. Add
                          @<owner>/<repo> to fetch a system from a different repo than --catalog-repo
                          (e.g. meshcore-mobile@yschimke/meshcore-mobile).
        --catalogs-unlisted <system>[@<owner>/<repo>][,…]
                          Like --catalogs, but served WITHOUT a front-page nav link — reachable at
                          /<system>/ and ?session=<system> but hidden from the landing "Design
                          systems" row. For app design systems we publish but keep off the front door.
        --catalogs-file <path>
                          The catalog set as CONFIG, not flags: a catalogs.json listing every
                          catalog to serve ({"groups":[…],"catalogs":[{"system","repo","listed",
                          "group"}]}). Meant to live outside the container image (a mounted volume)
                          so publishing a catalog is a config edit, not an image rebuild. The
                          "group" names a front-page section from "groups" — a claim honoured only
                          when the catalog's bytes really came from the entry's repo (or one of its
                          "attributionRepos"), so an id like compose-m3 can't buy a section. Entries
                          here come first; --catalogs / --catalogs-unlisted add to them. May also
                          carry "sites" (see --sites).
        --sites <host>=<system>[,…]
                          Top-level sites: serve an already-published catalog on a hostname of its
                          own, where it looks like the whole server (e.g.
                          m3.preview.coo.ee=m3-catalog serves what /m3-catalog/ serves). On that
                          host the catalog's landing is /, every link stays inside the domain, the
                          front-door index and the "all design systems" back link are gone, /status
                          + /sitemap.xml cover that app only, and /<other-system>/ 404s while
                          /<this-system>/… 301s to the rooted URL. Same sessions, same baked pixels,
                          same daemons — a site is a view of the box, not a second one. The system
                          must be one this server already serves; catalogs.json's "sites" says the
                          same thing as config, and POST /admin/sites says it on a running server
                          (see --admin-token), writing it back to --catalogs-file. Two things this
                          does NOT do, because they are outside the app: DNS for the name must point
                          at this box, and the reverse proxy must match the name and hold a
                          certificate for it.
        --admin-token <value>
                          Enable the runtime admin API and gate it with this secret. Two surfaces:
                          the catalog set — GET /admin/catalogs, POST /admin/catalogs (a
                          catalogs.json entry as the body), DELETE /admin/catalogs/<system> — and
                          the producer-trust store — GET /admin/trust, POST /admin/trust
                          ({"kind":"branch"|"key"|"oidc",…}), DELETE /admin/trust?kind=&repo=…
                          (selectors ride the query string so an owner/repo needn't be escaped).
                          the front-page sections — GET /admin/groups, POST /admin/groups
                          ({"id","heading","noun"}), DELETE /admin/groups/<id>. Defining a section
                          also regroups catalogs already registered, and re-POSTing a published
                          catalog converges its listing (group / listed) in place. And the
                          top-level sites — GET /admin/sites, POST /admin/sites
                          ({"host","system"}), DELETE /admin/sites/<host> — so a hostname can be
                          published on a running box; re-POSTing one whose system changed re-points
                          it in place. The edge still has to route the name and hold a certificate
                          for it (see --sites).
                          And onboarding — POST /admin/onboard ({"url","group","listed"}) takes a
                          GitHub project URL in any spelling, discovers the delivery branches that
                          repository already publishes, and registers each one exactly as POST
                          /admin/catalogs would, so a project is onboarded without spelling out its
                          catalog ids. Per-catalog outcomes come back in the body; re-posting the
                          same URL converges rather than erroring. A repository that has never run
                          `compose-preview publish` has nothing to serve yet and answers 404.
                          Onboarding a project that has NEVER published a catalog starts with POST
                          /admin/onboard/scan ({"url","ref"}), which shallow-clones the repository
                          and REPORTS which Gradle modules hold @Preview functions and which the
                          preview plugin can be injected into — it reads the checkout and executes
                          nothing. Building such a project is not this server's job: that runs on a
                          GitHub Actions runner in the import staging repository, which publishes an
                          ordinary design-artifacts/<system> branch this box then onboards above.
                          Mutations are applied live AND written back to --catalogs-file /
                          --trust-store, so they survive a restart. Separate from --token on purpose
                          (a --public box hands that one to every visitor); omitted = the admin
                          routes don't exist at all. NB with --allow-render-trusted this token can
                          grant server-side execution, since trusting a branch makes that
                          producer's Compose eligible for re-render here.
        --onboard-cache <dir>
                          Where POST /admin/onboard/scan checks repositories out to read them (one
                          directory per repo, reused). Nothing in them is executed. Default: a
                          temporary directory, forgotten on restart.
        --engagement-file <path>
                          Persist privacy-minimal aggregate catalog/app and per-preview view counts
                          as JSON. No IPs, cookies, user agents, or referrers are stored. Omitted =
                          counters last only for this server process.
        --catalog-repo <owner/repo>
                          Default repo the catalogs are fetched from (default
                          yschimke/compose-ai-tools); per-entry @<owner>/<repo> overrides it.
        --catalog-branch-prefix <prefix>
                          Branch prefix for --catalogs (default design-artifacts/).
        --catalog-max-images <count>
                          Maximum baked previews loaded from one published catalog (default
                          ${ServeDefaults.CATALOG_MAX_IMAGES}). Images are fetched lazily; this
                          bounds registered preview metadata and routes, not eager image downloads.
        --catalog-refresh-interval <seconds>
                          Keep a running server fresh: re-check each --catalogs branch's head every
                          <seconds> and re-fetch (catalog.json + renders + web/wasm/ + liveBundle) in
                          place when it moved — so a regenerated branch is picked up with no restart
                          (default ${ServeDefaults.DEFAULT_CATALOG_REFRESH_SECONDS}s; 0 disables, serving the boot snapshot only). Uses
                          `git ls-remote` (no API rate limit), and skips a branch it can't resolve.
        --catalog-feed-idle-timeout <seconds>
                          Publish /<catalog>/feed.xml. A request renews that feed's background
                          history-computation lease; after this many seconds without another request
                          it stops fetching while keeping the last generated feed and shallow Git
                          cache (default ${ServeDefaults.DEFAULT_CATALOG_FEED_IDLE_SECONDS}s; 0 disables).
        --catalog-feed-cache <dir>
                          Durable shallow-Git + generated-XML cache for catalog feeds. Defaults to a
                          catalog-feeds directory beside --catalogs-file, or a temp dir in local mode.
        --catalog-cache-dir <dir>|none
                          Durable, content-addressed store for the heavy bytes a catalog fetches —
                          the executable liveBundle, its per-preview splits and the externalised
                          resource pool — so a reload or a restart re-reads them instead of pulling
                          ~100 MB per live catalog again. Unset (and `none`) keeps the temp-dir pool
                          this always had, which dies with the process; there is no derived default,
                          because the obvious one is the config volume. Only bytes addressed by a
                          commit-pinned URL are cached, so a load that could not resolve its
                          delivery commit populates nothing.
        --catalog-cache-max-bytes <n>
                          Ceiling for that store (default
                          ${ServeDefaults.CATALOG_BLOB_POOL_MAX_BYTES / (1024L * 1024 * 1024)} GB).
                          Reclaimed oldest-first after the startup pass and after each later
                          catalog publication; blobs newer than an hour are spared so the replicas
                          that overlap during a rolling update cannot evict each other's.
        --theme-cache-dir <dir>|none
                          Durable store for warmed theme renders, so background warming survives a
                          restart and a catalog refresh. `none` disables it. Defaults to a
                          theme-cache directory beside --catalogs-file — note that on the prebuilt
                          image that is the persistent config volume, so pass `none` to keep it off;
                          with no durable location the cache stays in memory only
                          (there is deliberately no temp-dir fallback — it would be thrown away with
                          the process). Entries are keyed by a fingerprint of the render classpath,
                          daemon variant, tool version and render config, so a new catalog revision
                          or server build never reads the previous one's pixels.
        --theme-cache-max-bytes <n>
                          Ceiling for that store across every catalog (default
                          ${ServeDefaults.THEME_CACHE_MAX_BYTES / (1024L * 1024 * 1024)} GB). Superseded
                          generations are reclaimed; generations still in use are never evicted, so
                          exceeding this is reported rather than acted on.
        --theme-cache-evict
                          Delete every persisted theme-render generation at startup, before any is
                          opened. For when the pixels on the volume are known to be wrong — a base
                          image that changed the installed fonts, say, which no fingerprint sees.
                          Ordinary renderer changes need no eviction: entries written by another
                          build are withheld until a re-rendered sample agrees with them, and the
                          whole generation is discarded when it does not.
        --background-renders <n>
                          Background (theme-optimizer) renders admitted at once, server-wide.
                          Defaults to a value derived from --live-seats, which clamps at
                          ${ServeDefaults.MAX_DERIVED_CONCURRENT_RENDERS} — a ceiling reached
                          at 8 seats, so a bigger box stops widening this lane while everything else
                          scales. Name it explicitly to go past that; the seat budget still bounds
                          how many daemons the renders can occupy.
        --theme-optimizer-coordination-dir <dir>
                          Shared directory used to coordinate background optimizer lanes across
                          server replicas. Defaults to optimizer-locks beside --catalogs-file; set
                          this explicitly when replicas do not share that directory.
        --wasm-dir <system>=<dir>[,<system>=<dir>…]
                          In-browser CMP tier: map a design system to its assembled Kotlin/Wasm
                          catalog app (./gradlew :samples:cmp-wasm-catalog:wasmCatalogDist →
                          build/wasmDist). That session's viewer then offers a "Run in browser
                          (Wasm)" toggle that mounts the M3 components client-side (no server
                          round-trip), served read-only at /wasm/<system>/. Missing dirs are skipped.
        --wasm-ui-dir <dir>
                          Catalog browser fallback served at /wasm/<system>/ for every known
                          catalog that does not publish its own Wasm app. The catalog id comes from
                          the path; /wasm/preview-ui/ redirects to this catalog-scoped form.
        --ui-builder-dir <dir>
                          Standalone Compose UI builder distribution served at /ui-builder/.
                          This is additive and does not replace or alter /wasm/<system>/.
        --ui-builder-catalogs <system>[,<system>…]
                          Explicit catalog allowlist for catalog-scoped builder instances at
                          /ui-builder/<system>/. Defaults to m3-catalog. Serving a catalog does not
                          enable its builder automatically.
        --ui-builder-runtime-dir <runtimeId>=<dir>[,<runtimeId>=<dir>…]
                          Retained immutable native renderer bundles. Each directory must contain
                          runtime-manifest.json. Runtime ids are exact pins; there is no latest
                          fallback.
        --ui-builder-state-dir <dir>|none
                          Durable authoritative design store used by the UI-builder HTTP and
                          WebSocket API. Defaults to ui-builder-state beside --catalogs-file, or
                          ~/.compose-preview/ui-builder-state for a local standalone builder.
                          `none` serves static builder assets without the editable design API.
        --ui-builder-migrate-state
                          Explicitly migrate a validated v1 design store to v2 before serving.
                          Retains the exact v1 generation for rollback; never runs implicitly.
        --rc-player-wasm-dir <dir>
                          Experimental non-JVM Remote Compose player produced by
                          :rc-player-wasm:wasmPlayerDist. Serves it at /rc-player-wasm/ and enables
                          the "CMP Wasm" RC backend for previews carrying a captured .rc document.

      The shareable link carries an unguessable token; requests without it get 404.
