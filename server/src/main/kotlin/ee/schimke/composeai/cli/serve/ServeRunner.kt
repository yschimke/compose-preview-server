/**
 * `compose-preview serve`, from the first port bind to the last shutdown hook.
 *
 * This is the body that used to live in `:cli`'s `ServeCommand`. It reaches its configuration
 * through [ServeOptions] and its build through [ServeBuildHost] — `by options`, so every flag reads
 * exactly as it did when it was a private val on the command — and it never sees `args`, `--help`,
 * the usage text, or a Gradle type.
 *
 * The point is not tidiness. While this code sat in `:cli`, the module boundary #4599 drew was true
 * of every serve file *except* the one that starts the server, and the seam register carried 92
 * symbols for this file alone. A preview server you cannot start without the CLI is not separable,
 * whatever the build files say.
