/**
 * The serve host's view of the catalog's **design pages** — whole specimen sheets from the design
 * file, cached as SVG, with the node id of every component on them.
 *
 * Where [ServeDesignReferenceStore] answers the per-component question ("does this Button match its
 * Figma node?"), this answers the sheet-level one: *here is the kit's own Shape page — which of
 * these 35 shapes do we implement, and does our render sit right where the design drew it?* The
 * shapes nothing implements are the point: an unlinked node is a finding, not an omission.
 *
 * ## Why the SVG is sanitized here and not at publish time
 *
 * Because *here* is the trust boundary. The markup is inlined into a served page — that is what
 * lets the viewer hide the design's own drawing of a node and put our render in its place — and a
 * catalog is third-party data all the way down ([ServeCatalogStore] stages one on that assumption).
 * A publish-time check would protect only the catalogs this repo happens to publish; the server
 * reads branches it did not write. [SvgSanitizer] runs once at load rather than per request: a
 * specimen sheet is hundreds of kilobytes, and parsing it on every open would be the surface's
 * whole cost.
 *
 * ## Failure posture
 *
 * Fail-soft throughout, like [ServeDesignReferenceStore] and [ServeParityActivityStore]: a missing
 * file, an unsupported version, a malformed page, a traversing image path or an export that does
 * not survive sanitizing drops that page — or the whole manifest — and the catalog serves its grid
 * exactly as before. A page view is an enhancement; it must never cost a catalog its previews.
 *
 * A manifest carries **free text authored in the design tool**: layer names like `Shape=Circle`.
 * Nothing here is trusted. Every string is HTML-escaped at render time by [ServeWeb], and the
 * outbound Figma deep link is *reassembled* from a validated file key and node id against a literal
 * origin ([ServeFigmaSpec]) rather than taken from the file, so a manifest declaring `javascript:…`
 * yields no link instead of an attacker-chosen href.
