/**
 * A [ServeHost] that fronts a trusted design-system catalog with its baked-PNG render **and** an
 * opt-in live daemon stream, bridging the two id namespaces so the published catalog URLs keep
 * working.
 *
 * ## Why
 *
 * A daemon knows its previews by the function-based descriptor id it discovered
 * (`FilledButton_Dark`), but the published `design-artifacts/<system>` catalog links + image routes
 * use the componentId-slug id (`button-filled__ideal__default__dark`) — and the two don't match.
 * Registering a bare [ServeRenderHost] for a catalog therefore 404s every published `/p/<id>` deep
 * link and `/render/<id>.png` thumbnail, drops the catalog's title/trust badge (only a
 * [ServeBundleHost] carries those), and — because a daemon host reports `canApplyOverrides = true`
 * — flips the viewer into dynamic mode, so ordinary browsing renders every preview through the
 * daemon (cold-start "rendering…") instead of showing the instant baked PNG.
 *
 * ## What
 *
 * This composite keeps the [baked] [ServeBundleHost] as the whole **snapshot** surface —
 * [previews], the grid, deep links, thumbnails, title, and trust badge all resolve to the baked
 * catalog exactly as a static catalog would, and every snapshot is the baked PNG (so browsing never
 * wakes the daemon). The [live] daemon is offered only through the **"Live (stream)"** toggle:
 * [hasLiveStream] is true, so the viewer enables the checkbox, and [subscribeStream] maps the
 * catalog id to the daemon preview id via [alias] and streams it. An id with no alias (an
 * Android-only variant the desktop daemon can't render) simply has no stream and stays baked.
 *
 * The net effect: the published catalog behaves exactly as before (static, trusted, instant), plus
 * the CMP components the desktop daemon can run gain an interactive live stream on demand.
 *
 * ## Per-preview live lane (default, with monolithic fallback)
 *
 * When [perPreviewResolve] is supplied, an override-bearing render/stream first tries to resolve a
 * daemon that re-renders **only that one preview** from its own per-preview bundle
 * (`bundle/previews/<daemon-id>.png`, materialised + pooled by the caller). This is the default
 * render path — small, addressable, per-preview daemons the pool reaps when idle — so the
 * per-preview bundles the delivery branch ships are exercised routinely. It falls back to the
 * monolithic [live] `liveBundle` daemon when a per-preview daemon can't be resolved (fetch /
 * materialise failed, or the preview ships no per-preview bundle), and both fall back to [baked]
 * when the id has no daemon twin at all. So the worst case is exactly the pre-per-preview
 * behaviour; the composite never regresses. With [perPreviewResolve] absent it is the plain
 * monolithic-only host described above.
