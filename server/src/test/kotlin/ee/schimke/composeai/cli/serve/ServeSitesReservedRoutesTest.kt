/**
 * [ServeSites.RESERVED_SYSTEMS] must name **every** constant first path segment [ServeHttpServer]
 * routes, and this reads the routing block to check it rather than trusting anyone to remember.
 *
 * The list has always been maintained by hand from that block, and the hand has slipped three times
 * now — `pg` (playground redemption swallowed by a site claiming the prefix), `motion` (every
 * published capture 404ing on every site host), and `report-bug` (issue #4319, the footer's own
 * link, on the deployments where visitors actually press it). Each was found in production, months
 * apart, because the failure is invisible on the main host: a missing entry only misbehaves on a
 * site hostname, which is exactly where nobody is running the test suite.
 *
 * [ServeTopLevelSiteTest] stays as it is and is the *other* half of this: it drives a live server
 * and asserts real routes reach real handlers, which is the only way to catch a list entry that is
 * spelled right and routed wrong. This one catches the omission itself, which that test cannot — a
 * route missing from the allowlist is missing from its loop too.
 *
 * Scanning source rather than the Ktor route tree is deliberate: the tree is built inside
 * `embeddedServer`'s private application, and a registration guarded by a config flag (`/feed.xml`
 * needs a feed configured, the `/admin/…` pair needs a token) simply would not be in it — so a
 * tree-walk would quietly under-report exactly the routes a fresh deployment is most likely to
 * enable later.

   * skipping what it cannot read.
