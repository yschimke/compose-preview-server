/**
 * The serve pages' **address-bar state**: what a visitor picked (a section tab, a theme, a filter,
 * a viewer override) is reflected into the page URL, so the page on screen is the page its URL
 * describes — bookmarkable, shareable, and reachable with Back.
 *
 * These are structural assertions on the emitted script; the behaviour itself (click a tab, read
 * `location.search`, go Back, see the previous tab) is driven in a real browser by
 * `preview-harness/serve-lanes.spec.mjs`. Both matter: this one fails fast in `:cli:test` when the
 * wiring is dropped, the browser one proves it actually navigates.
