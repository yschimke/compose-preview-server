/**
 * End-to-end check that the **viewer** offers the per-preview "report an issue" affordance, on a
 * real embedded [ServeHttpServer].
 *
 * Deliberately a route test rather than a fixture assertion. `ServeWebFixtureTest` builds its
 * goldens by calling [ServeWeb.viewerPage] directly with a `reportIssue` of its own, so the golden
 * kept showing the affordance for the whole period the HTTP handler was passing `reportIssue =
 * null` — a page nobody was serving. Only a request through the real route can tell "the renderer
 * can draw this" apart from "the server actually wires it".
 *
 * The body's shape is covered by [ServeIssueReportTest]; what is checked here is the wiring: that
 * the form is emitted, that it targets the repo owning the preview's Kotlin, that it carries the
 * overrides on screen, that it names the preview's design reference so the filed issue reaches the
 * parity index, and that the parity SCORE — the one reference-scoped fact this page cannot honestly
 * state — stays off it.
