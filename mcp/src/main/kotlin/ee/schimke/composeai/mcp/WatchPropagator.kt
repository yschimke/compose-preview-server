/**
 * Translates the union of every session's watch set into per-daemon `setVisible` / `setFocus`
 * notifications, so the daemon's render queue prioritises previews that any connected agent cares
 * about and keeps them warm.
 *
 * Design notes:
 *
 * - **Per (workspace, module).** Each daemon serves exactly one (workspace, module) pair, and the
 *   wire form of `setVisible` takes preview ids local to that daemon (the daemon doesn't know about
 *   workspaces). So we partition the watched URI set by daemon and emit one `setVisible` per
 *   affected daemon.
 * - **Idempotent / rate-limited.** [recompute] is called on every relevant change (`watch`,
 *   `unwatch`, `discoveryUpdated`, daemon spawn). We compare the new set against the last sent set
 *   per daemon and skip the wire call if unchanged — ordinary client-side debouncing isn't enough
 *   because `discoveryUpdated` can fire repeatedly in a short window.
 * - **Focus = same set as visible in v0.** Splitting "user is interacting" vs "user might want to
 *   look" requires sub-tool surface (e.g. `set_focus` MCP tool) we deliberately defer per
 *   MCP-KOTLIN.md § "Tools surface (v0)".
 *
 * The propagator is intentionally stateless w.r.t. *which* previews exist. The [previewIdProvider]
 * is supplied by the supervisor and reflects the daemon's current discovery state; the propagator
 * filters those candidates by the watch sets and forwards the result.
