"""The design-render lane's manifest and its sticky pull-request comment.

`design render --local` — this repository's own command — draws a **UI-builder design document**,
the thing a person assembled in the builder, saved as JSON and committed. That is not a `@Preview`,
so compose-ai-tools' `compare-previews.py` cannot report on it: that comparator is coupled to
`compose-preview show --json`, a preview id and a Gradle module, and a design has none of the three.
What the two share is the *shape* of the answer — a manifest pushed to a branch, and a comment whose
images are `raw.githubusercontent` URLs on it — so that shape is reproduced here deliberately and
the schemas are kept apart.

This lives beside the CLI it reports on, and that is the point: the workflow, the
`compose-preview-server` binary it invokes and the `compose-preview-host` image it runs in are all
released from this repository, so there is no version-skew seam between them to police.

Two commands:

  manifest  <dir> --out _designs.json [--refusal id=reason ...]
      Hash every PNG/SVG a render lane produced and write the manifest the branch carries. A design
      the export REFUSED is a row too, carrying its reason and no file: a refusal is the lane's most
      useful output (a design that cannot be exported cannot be reviewed as pixels either), and one
      that vanished from the manifest would read as a design nobody drew.

  comment   --head _designs.json [--baseline _designs.json] --repo owner/name
            --head-branch <branch> [--baseline-branch <branch>] [--out comment.md]
      The sticky comment: what changed, what appeared, what went away, what the export refuses, and
      a count of what stayed put. Unchanged designs are counted rather than shown — a comment that
      renders nineteen identical pictures on every pull request teaches a reviewer to scroll past it.

Pure stdlib, like every script in this directory, and tested by `test_design_renders.py`.
